        Hi all, my name is Jon.

      This website was created to assist non-Japanese readers in accessing YouTube content without the need for translation or assistance. It aims to provide a convenient platform for users to view YouTube videos and guides in their preferred language.

      Additionally, I have created this site to curate and showcase useful guides that have been shared by the community on Reddit. With the vast amount of information available, it can be challenging to find and keep track of these valuable resources. This website serves as a central hub to gather and organize these guides for easy access and reference.
